FormSnoop was a utility I wrote that allowed you to fill in a form on a webpage, press a hotkey, and the contents of all
of the form items would be saved. Press the hotkey again and all of the saved items would be restored (hey, this was 2001).

This is another ancient little utility I created back in the day, that combined C++, the Win32 APIs and the IE BHO API.
It also included some basic serialization functionality.

In case you dont remember what BHOs (Browser Helper Objects) were, they were a way of being able to plug into the browsers'
functionality, and basically script a browser session. Nowadays browsers have nice extension APIs, but back in 2001 it was 
C++ and IE libraries all the way!
